# 👋 Welcome to MergeBetter

**Prevent GitHub merge conflicts before they happen.**

MergeBetter is a GitHub App that proactively analyzes open pull requests across your repositories and warns you about potential conflicts early — so your team can coordinate before PRs get blocked.

---

## 🚀 What We Do

- 🔍 **Proactive Detection** – Detect overlapping changes in open PRs before they cause conflicts.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Analysis** – Every push and sync is checked instantly.  
- 🤝 **Team Coordination** – Know which PRs conflict so you can resolve them early.  
- 🔒 **Secure by Default** – We only analyze diffs; your source code never leaves GitHub.  

---

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Install the GitHub App**: [MergeBetter App](https://mergebetter.com)  
2. **Select your repositories** (try it safely on a test repo if you like).  
3. **Push a PR** and let MergeBetter warn you about conflicts before they land.  

👉 No CI setup. No YAML. Just install and go.

## 🐎 About Us

MergeBetter was built by developers (and one horse farmer 🐴) who got tired of stepping on each other’s toes in greenfield codebases.  
We believe if two engineers are changing the same code at the same time, that’s a conversation worth having *before* Git yells at you.
